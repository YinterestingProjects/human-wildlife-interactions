# human-wildlife-interactions üêò 

Increasingly, social media platforms document and reflect the range of societal interests in wildlife, from conservation advocacy and nature appreciation to promotional advertisement for hunting outfitters. Understanding and monitoring the landscape of human interests in wildlife is critical to conservation efforts in the modern world. For our project we chose to focus on Youtube as an example platform and hope to explore the following questions:

- Given a set of videos with wildlife-related tags, can we extract meaningful groups of interest through clustering?
- What are the key characteristics that of each interest group?
- Building on meaningful interest labels, can we train a multi-modal classifier to further identify video content that potentially jeopardizes biodiversity?
